Currently working at WebEngine, a Dutch web-development company based in Eindhoven.</em></p><p>I started out developing custom WordPress themes & plugins as a freelancer for small to medium sized companies. WordPress always was, and still is my go-to CMS to develop small to medium sized websites and even web-applications. Especially since the rise of the WP-Rest API, I've even been using WordPress as the backend of some of my (web-) apps.</p><p>Two years ago I was getting bored working alone as a freelancer and applied for a job at WebEngine. At WebEngine I had the opportunity to work on bigger projects and bigger clients, together with a couple of awesome colleagues.</p><p>At the end of 2016 my girlfriend and I moved to Munich, and I was lucky enough to be able to keep on working for WebEngine from my home-office in Munich.</p><p>At WebEngine I got the opportunity to specialize in javascript frontend libraries/frameworks, such as React. Currently I am working on several enterprise level projects, that evolve around a React/Redux/Symofony2 system.</p><h2>Skillset</h2><p>Over the last couple of years I have gathered a broad spectrum of (web) development skills. Besides the standard HTML, CSS, jQuery and vanilla Javascript (ES5 and ES6) I also have decent experience with PHP, Symfony2, Twig, Bootstrap and Sass/SCSS/Less.</p><p>Currently my biggest passion lies in React/Redux and several other JS frameworks and libraries. I also feel right at home on the command line, and Git is a natural part of my workflow.</p><p>While working at WebEngine I learned to work with the Atlassian stack (Confluence, Jira and Stash). Webpack, Grunt, NPM, Yarn and Composer are also part of my skillset.</p>",
